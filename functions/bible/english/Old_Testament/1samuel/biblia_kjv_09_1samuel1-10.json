          "4": "And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:",
          "5": "But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.",
          "6": "And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.",
          "7": "And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.",
          "8": "Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?",
          "9": "So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.",
          "10": "And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.",
          "11": "And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.",
