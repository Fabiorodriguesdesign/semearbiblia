      "15": "And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.",
      "16": "And all the people that [were] in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.",
      "17": "And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.",

      "25": "And [so] it was, [that] all that fell that day, both of men and women, [were] twelve thousand, [even] all the men of Ai.",
      "26": "For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.",
      "27": "Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.",
      "28": "And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, [even] a desolation unto this day.",
      "29": "And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, [that remaineth] unto this day.",
      "30": "Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,",
      "31": "As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up [any] iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.",
      "32": "And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.",
      "33": "And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.",
      "34": "And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.",
